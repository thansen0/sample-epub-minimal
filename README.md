Minimal Ebook
==============

This is a minimal epub ebook file.  It contains no cover, and only has two chapters and a copyright at the end.  The purpose of this is so that people are able to compare their ebooks with this and hopefully more easily make their own ebooks.

For those that just want to work with and build this ebook to see how it works, you should be able to download it, compress the folder to a zip, and then rename it using the extension .epub.  This should then be a readable ebook.  Lastly the .epub file contained is the epub created from the folder.

You may read more about .epub's at their official site, http://idpf.org/epub, or at their official and much more complex samples, https://github.com/IDPF/epub3-samples.
